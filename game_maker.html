    <p id="guide">
        Start by making a Python File with your gameplay that will be ran in the Terminal.<br>
        <br>
        Once you made your file, give it a unique name and make sure it ends with '.py'.<br>
        <br>
        Make sure to make a github repository with all of the code and a 'README.md'.<br>
        <br>
        And then send the code to termoxers@gmail.com.<br>
        <br>
        If your file contains any libraries that aren't in the standard library then add a 'requirements.txt' file.<br>
        <br>
        Your game will have to be approved by any Staff.<br>
        <br>
        Hope to see your game!<br>
    </p>
